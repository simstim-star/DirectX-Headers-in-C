# DirectX Headers in C
This repository is a port of [DirectX-Headers](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Headers) to C.
I'm developing it as a companion to my other project, [DirectX-Graphics-Samples-in-C](https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectX-Graphics-Samples-in-C), writing the headers as I need them to port the examples.

## Ways to consume
For now, the only way is manually: copy the headers somewhere and point your project at them.
